Putting my HTML skills to the test. Thus far, I have learned how to add my own boilerplate, the difference between elements and tags, the best tags to use for formatting as well as those that can be read by a screen reader (increase accessibility), how to create ordered and unordered list, how to link other pages (relative and absolute), and the what image format works best for what feature. 

My task is to create a recipe website using what I have learned. I am looking forward to it!
