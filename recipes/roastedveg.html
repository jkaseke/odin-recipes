        <!--Description/Backstory-->
        <h2 id="sec-header">Description</h2>
        <p>Carrots and parsnips, my favorite root vegetables. For me, the best way to work with root vegetables is to let them caramelize, which brings out their uniquely sweet and nutty flavors.
            This is a very moreish dish that does that and more, dialing up the flavor with a complementary dressing of brown butter, hazelnut, and maple syrup.</p>
        <p>Although technically a side dish, it pairs excellently with roasted meats or alongside other veggie dishes. I like to serve on yogurt for a tangy contrast. To turn it into a main, 
            try and serve it on some warm burgur wheat or brown lentils.</p>
        <p>Enjoy this show-stealer!</p>

        <!--Steps-->
        <h3 id="sec-header">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C. Peel celery root. Wash sweet potato, parsnip and carrots, and pat dry. Slice all lengthwise into long wedges, then halve again, if desired. 
                Spread vegetables on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, some maple syrup, and season with some flaky sea salt. Add whole, unpeeled garlic cloves to the baking sheet. Transfer to the 
                oven and bake for approx. 30 to 40 mins until they are cooked and just beginning to brown.</li>
            <li>While the vegetables are roasting, roughly chop the hazelnuts. Zest and juice the lemon. Approx. 10 mins before the end of the roasting time, add hazelnuts to a dry frying pan over 
                medium heat and toast until they are just beginning to brown. Then, add the butter and continue to cook on medium heat until it foams, begins to brown and smell nutty, approx. 1 to 2 mins. 
                Remove from the heat and whist in remaining maple syrup and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Remove vegetables from the oven. Remove the garlic and carefully squeeze them to release the creamy inner into a bowl. Use a fork to mash into a paste. Then, whisk the garlic paste into 
                the warm hazelnut butter dressing and mix well to combine. To assemble, spread Greek yogurt onto a large serving platter. Top with the roasted root vegetables and drizzle with the hazelnut 
                brown butter. Garnish with lemon zest, tear curly parsley over the top. and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</li>
        </ol>
